   abstract = {This paper presents a method for automatic on-line color calibration of soccer-playing robots. Our method requires a geometrical model of the field-lines in world coordinates, and one of the ball in image coordinates. No specific assumptions are made about the color of the field, ball, or goals except that they are of roughly homogeneous distinct colors, and that the field-lines are bright relative to the field. The classification works by localizing the robot (without using color information), then growing homogeneously colored regions and matching their size and shape with those of the expected regions. If a region matches the expected one, its color is added to the respective color class. This method can be run in a background thread thus enabling the robot to quickly recalibrate in response to changes in illumination. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

   abstract = {In this article we present an automatic on-line color calibration system that makes extensive use of the spatial relationships between color classes in the color space. First, we introduce the definition of class-relative color spaces, where classes are represented in terms of their spatial relation to a base color class. Then, using class-relative color spaces, the system is able to remap classes from the already trained ones, which gives a starting point for training the remaining classes. The color-calibrating system also uses a feedback from the detected objects using the remapped (or partially trained) classes. As a result, the system is able to generate a complete color look-up table from scratch, and to adapt quickly to severe lighting condition changes. A particularity of our system is that it does not need to solve the natural ambiguity in color classes' intersections, but it is able to keep and use it during color segmentation using the concept of soft-colors. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

   abstract = {The field of machine learning has taken a dramatic twist in recent times,
with the rise of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). These biologically
inspired computational models are able to far exceed the performance of
previous forms of artificial intelligence in common machine learning tasks. One
of the most impressive forms of ANN architecture is that of the Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). CNNs are primarily used to solve difficult image-driven
pattern recognition tasks and with their precise yet simple architecture,
offers a simplified method of getting started with ANNs. This document provides a brief introduction to CNNs, discussing recently
published papers and newly formed techniques in developing these brilliantly
fantastic image recognition models. This introduction assumes you are familiar
with the fundamentals of ANNs and machine learning.},

   abstract = {In RoboCup soccer, ball localization is an important and challenging task, especially since the last change of the rule which allows 50 per cent of the ball’s surface to be of any color or pattern while the rest must remain white. Multi-color balls have changing color histograms and patterns in dependence of the current orientation and movement. This paper presents a neural approach using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to localize the ball in various scenes. CNNs were used in several image recognition tasks, particularly because of their capability to learn invariances in images. In this work we use CNNs to locate a ball by training two output layers, representing the x- and y-coordinates, with normal distributions fitted around the ball. Therefore the network not only locates the ball’s position but also provides an estimation of the noise. The architecture processes the whole image in full size, no sliding-window approach is used.},

Despite their success, localizing the ball in real-world RoboCup Soccer scenes is still challenging. Especially considering real-time requirements and the limited computing power of humanoid robots. Another important reason is the lack of training and test data as well as baseline models to start with or compare to.

   abstract = {In robotic soccer a good ball position estimate is essential for successful play. Given the uncertainties in the perception of each individual robot, merging the local perceptions of the robots into a global ball estimate often results in a more reliable estimate and helps to increase team performance. Robots can use the global ball position even if they themselves do not see the ball or they can use it to adjust their own perception faults. In this paper we report on our results of comparing state-of-the-art sensor fusion techniques like Kalman filters or the Monte Carlo approach in RoboCup's Middle-size league. We compare our results to previously published work from other Middle-size league teams and show how the quality of perceiving the ball position is increased. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

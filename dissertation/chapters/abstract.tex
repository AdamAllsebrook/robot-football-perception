\chapter*{\Large \center Abstract}

Robot football is a problem in which two opposing teams of robots autonomously play a game of football. Robots are developed not just to compete in these games, but to develop new technologies for the wider field of robotics. A key part of the problem is developing an effective method of ball awareness for the robot.

The aim of this project is to build a ball perception system and trajectory prediction for the MiRo robot. This involves creating a computer vision algorithm which is robust to a very dynamic world state, as well as accurately modelling the trajectory of the ball, to allow players to quickly and efficiently intercept it. 

The project successfully develops an efficient ball detection algorithm using non-neural methods including a circular Hough transform and a support-vector machine classifier with a histogram of oriented gradients feature descriptor, as well as overcoming problems with image space to world space conversion.
